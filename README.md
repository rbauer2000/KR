Examples and Exercises for Kernighan and Ritchies's "The C Programming Language"

Starting out, I am just typing in the examples in the book.  Perhaps later I'll work the exercises and include them here.  For now, this gives me a little practice typing in C programs and I'll learn a little following along in textbook.  Also, I'm using VIM, and this will give some practice using VIM.
